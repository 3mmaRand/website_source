Following on from our post on [R in Africa](https://rforwards-auto.github.io/blog/2017/12/01/r-in-africa/) this 
next post in the series looks at the R community across Central and South 
America.

## Conferences

### International Seminar on Statistics with R

### Brazil R Day

### Latin R

### ConectaR 2019

Recently, a number of R conferences have come to Latin America for the first time. In 2019, it is Costa Rica's turn: [ConectaR 2019](www.conectar2019.org) will take place in San Jos√©. The event has the endorsement of R Foundation and will be hosted at the [University of Costa Rica (UCR)](www.ucr.ac.cr). ConectaR has an organizing committee composed by academia ([School of Statistics](www.estadistica.ucr.ac.cr), [Pure and Applied Mathematics Research Center (CIMPA)](www.cimpa.ucr.ac.cr)), public research centers ([The Development Observatory](www.odd.ucr.ac.cr), [Bioversity International (CGIAR)](https://www.bioversityinternational.org/)) and industry ([ixpantia](www.ixpantia.com)). ConectaR will have two keynote speakers (yet to be confirmed) and will be receiving proposals for oral presentations and posters starting April 2018.  In addition to that, there will be tutorials, invited talks, and a job fair. An attendance of over 150 people is expected, with the goal of building a community of R users in the Central American Region.

## Workshops

### R/Bioconductor Latin American Developers' Workshop (Cuernavaca, Mexico, July 30 - Aug 3, 2018).

In recent years, biology has seen a rise in the use of technologies that enable high-throughput, quantitative, data-rich profiling of cellular states. As a result, the field faces computational challenges to analyse such data. The [R/Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) project is an open source, open development software platform that provides tools to translate complex datasets into biological knowledge.

The workshop is aimed at students and researchers interested in the analysis of biological data. We encourage applications from diverse disciplines, including but not limited to biologists, bioinformaticians, data scientists, software engineers and programmers. The main goals of the workshop are:

1. Teaching participants the principles of reproducible data science through the development of R/Bioconductor packages. 
2. Turning bioinformatic software users into bioinformatic software developers.
3. Fostering the exchange of expertise and establishing multidisciplinary collaborations.
4. Creating a community of Latin American scientists committed to the development of software and computational pipelines for biological data analysis. 
5. Helping to train bioinformatics instructors that can continue to grow in their local communities.

This workshop is part of a long-term project to create a community of developers from Latin America. We hope to hold regular meetings in the future (similar to [BioC](https://bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2017/BioC2017/), [EuroBioc](https://bioconductor.github.io/EuroBioc2017/) and [BioCAsia](https://www.abacbs.org/biocasia2016)) where attendees present their own software contributions.  

A website containing more details will be available soon.
