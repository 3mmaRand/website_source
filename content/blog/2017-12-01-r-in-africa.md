## satRdays in Cape Town

The first [satRday (Cape Town)](http://capetown2017.satrdays.org/) was held on 18 February 2017. The event was held at [Workshop 17](http://workshop17.co.za/) in the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront. We had three great keynote speakers ([Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan), [Julia Silge](https://twitter.com/juliasilge) and [Steph Locke](https://twitter.com/SteffLocke))
