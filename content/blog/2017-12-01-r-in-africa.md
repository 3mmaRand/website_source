## satRdays in Cape Town

Following the first successful [satRday in Budapest](http://budapest.satrdays.org/) on 3 September 2016, we hosted a [satRday in Cape Town](http://capetown2017.satrdays.org/) on 18 February 2017. The event was held at [Workshop 17](http://workshop17.co.za/) in the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront. We had three great keynote speakers ([Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan), [Julia Silge](https://twitter.com/juliasilge) and [Steph Locke](https://twitter.com/SteffLocke)). In addition to the invited speakers we received 41 contributed proposals, of which 23 were accepted: 3 tutorials, 8 standard talks and 12 lightning talks. Just over 200 tickets were issued for the event and the venue was literally packed. On two days prior to the conference there were workshops by the keynote speakers. These were also very well attended.

We are planning a second [satRday in Cape Town](http://capetown2018.satrdays.org/) on 17 March 2018. We are excited to have [MaÃ«lle Salmon](https://twitter.com/maelle) and [Stephanie Kovalchik](https://twitter.com/StatsOnTheT) as keynote speakers. They will be presenting workshops on R package development and sports analytics with R on the day prior to the conference.

Next year's conference will be held at a bigger venue on campus of the University of Cape Town. So we will be able to accommodate even more enthusiastic R users. Tickets are on sale and the [Call for Papers](https://www.papercall.io/satrday-cape-town-2018) is open.
