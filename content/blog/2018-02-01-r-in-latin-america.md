Following on from our post on [R in Africa](http://forwards.github.io/blog/2017/12/01/r-in-africa/) this 
next post in the series looks at the R community across Latin America.

## Conferences

As the use of R has grown in Latin America, there has been an increasing demand 
for local R conferences. The community has responded and a number of conferences
are planned for the coming months.

### International Seminar on Statistics with R

One of the first to spot the demand was Luciane Alcoforado, a professor at the
Fluminense Federal University (UFF) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Realizing there was 
no large R event in Brazil, she set about coordinating the first International
Seminar on Statistics with R ([SER: Seminário Internacional de Estatística com 
R](http://serrio2016.weebly.com/)), which was held in Niterói in May 2016.

More than 250 people attended this pioneering event, with attendance balanced 
across academia and industry. Encouraged by this success, the I SER organizers 
ran the event again in 2017, with an expanded program and similar numbers 
attending.

A third edition, [III SER](http://www.ser.uff.br/), is now planned for 
May 22-24, 2018, to be hosted again by UFF in Niterói, Brazil. 
On the first day of III SER, 8 mini courses will
be run, aimed at both practitioners and students. This year most of the
international guests come from the USA and England. They include
Jesse Mostipak, Becky Pattinson, Garreth Maccray, and Gabriela de Queiroz.
These guests will present alongside invited speakers from the local region. There
will also be thirty selected contributed talks and a poster session with
awards for the best three of each. It’s a huge opportunity to get your research 
known. The last conference day will close
with a tribute session to Prof. Djalma Pessoa who was a pioneer R user
in Brazil.

Registration to III SER and the minicourses is open now and the call for papers 
is open until March 23 2018.

### Brazil R Day

### LatinR

On October 25, 2017, an announcement was made by Heather Turner on the RUG Organizers Slack: the R Foundation Conference Committee would like to see academic-focused R events in regions not currently covered by useR! In less than a week, a group of Latam R-Ladies were organizing their first conference-call to start thinking about how this challenge could be achieved. This quick response was not the result of mere chance, but the consequence of a year in which the R community — both RUG and R-Ladies groups — grew stronger in South America. By mid November everything was set-up: a name, a place, a date, and a motivated international organizing committee. 

LatinR 2018 will be held in Buenos Aires on September 4-5 within the 47th Argentinian Meeting of Informatics and Operational Research (JAIIO), which is organized by The Argentinian Informatics Society (SADIO). With a diverse and renowned Scientific Committee, this two-day event aims to bring together researchers, students, and R-enthusiasts from different backgrounds in order to strengthen the R community and make the impact that R is having in the region more visible, in both academic and non academic contexts. 

For more information about oral presentations & poster submission, keynotes, and workshops, you can check out the [LatinR website](http://latin-r.com/en) or follow us on Twitter and Facebook: @LatinR2018.

### ConectaR 2019

Recently, a number of R conferences have come to Latin America for the first time. In 2019, it is Costa Rica's turn: [ConectaR 2019](www.conectar2019.org) will take place in San José. The event has the endorsement of R Foundation and will be hosted at the [University of Costa Rica (UCR)](www.ucr.ac.cr). ConectaR has an organizing committee composed by academia ([School of Statistics](www.estadistica.ucr.ac.cr), [Pure and Applied Mathematics Research Center (CIMPA)](www.cimpa.ucr.ac.cr)), public research centers ([The Development Observatory](www.odd.ucr.ac.cr), [Bioversity International (CGIAR)](https://www.bioversityinternational.org/)) and industry ([ixpantia](www.ixpantia.com)). ConectaR will have two keynote speakers (yet to be confirmed) and will be receiving proposals for oral presentations and posters starting April 2018.  In addition to that, there will be tutorials, invited talks, and a job fair. An attendance of over 150 people is expected, with the goal of building a community of R users in the Central American Region.

## Workshops

### R/Bioconductor Latin American Developers' Workshop (Cuernavaca, Mexico, July 30 - Aug 3, 2018).

In recent years, biology has seen a rise in the use of technologies that enable high-throughput, quantitative, data-rich profiling of cellular states. As a result, the field faces computational challenges to analyse such data. The [R/Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) project is an open source, open development software platform that provides tools to translate complex datasets into biological knowledge.

The workshop is aimed at students and researchers interested in the analysis of biological data. We encourage applications from diverse disciplines, including but not limited to biologists, bioinformaticians, data scientists, software engineers and programmers. The main goals of the workshop are:

1. Teaching participants the principles of reproducible data science through the development of R/Bioconductor packages. 
2. Turning bioinformatic software users into bioinformatic software developers.
3. Fostering the exchange of expertise and establishing multidisciplinary collaborations.
4. Creating a community of Latin American scientists committed to the development of software and computational pipelines for biological data analysis. 
5. Helping to train bioinformatics instructors that can continue to grow in their local communities.

This workshop is part of a long-term project to create a community of developers from Latin America. We hope to hold regular meetings in the future (similar to [BioC](https://bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2017/BioC2017/), [EuroBioc](https://bioconductor.github.io/EuroBioc2017/) and [BioCAsia](https://www.abacbs.org/biocasia2016)) where attendees present their own software contributions.  

A website containing more details will be available soon.
