### Workshop Description

Curious about package development, but not sure where to start? This workshop is for you! Run by R-Ladies Chicago, the goal of this workshop is to empower you to start contributing back to the R ecosystem with package development. We'll be using materials developed by Hadley Wickham, Jenny Bryan, and Di Cook for the [FoRwards organization](https://forwards.github.io/about/).

By the end of this day-long workshop, you should know how to:

- make your code into an R package, 
- do collaborative coding with GitHub, 
- write a vignette or an article, 
- build a web page for your package, and
- submit a package to CRAN. 

Bring your own code that you want to make into a package, or work with our example. 

### Cost and Travel Support
Thanks to funding from the <a href="https://www.r-consortium.org/" target="_blank">R Consortium</a>, this workshop is free for participants.  Lunch will be provided.
