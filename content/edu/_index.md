Workshops for Women and Girls
------

### Overview

Thanks to generous funding from the [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/), Forwards is pleased to offer the following workshops to support the development of coding skills and increase the participation of women in the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) community:

- *Workshops for women* are designed for women with some R coding experience who wish to learn more about package development, thereby addressing the skills gap that exists within the R community.  As of 2016, an [analysis of CRAN package maintainers](http://forwards.github.io/data/) estimated that fewer than 15% were women, and a [user! participant survey]( http://forwards.github.io/blog/2017/03/11/users-relationship-with-r/) found that women were less likely than men to have experience contributing to or writing packages.  Workshop participants learn to make code into an R package, do collaborative coding with GitHub, write a vignette or an article, build a package web page, and submit a package to CRAN.  Participants can bring their own code that they wish to develop into a package or work with a Forwards example.

- *Workshops for high school girls* serve as an introduction to coding in R and are designed for students interested in STEM, coding, and data analysis.  Participants learn about plotting data, web scraping, and the development of Shiny apps.  A selection of topics related to contemporary current affairs are used, and where possible, incorporate data specific to the workshop’s geographic location.
