## Women's workshops

Learn how to make your code into an R package, do collaborative coding with github, submit your package to CRAN, write a vignette or article for the R Journal, and build a web page for your package. This workshop is for women who have done some R coding and are ready to take the next step in providing it to others to use. Bring your own code, or work with our example. 

- Melbourne: TBD
- Auckland, Dec 7, Auckland University.  Instructors are Hadley Wickham, Jenny Bryan and Di Cook. [Register](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/forwards-workshop-for-women-in-auckland-tickets-38425568911)
