# Teaching examples

We wish to provide a resource enabling more diverse and inclusive examples to be used in teaching R. Often examples are based on subjects that tend to be more appealing to men (men's sport, cars, finance) or have a US/Western bias (politics, movies/pop songs). While such examples may still be interesting to people that don't usually think much about these things, more diverse and inclusive examples will help to engage a wider set of people.

Action focuses on three points:

1. Detect and discourage use of "bad" widely used examples
2. Collect/produce more diverse examples
3. Collect/produce examples about gender and inclusivity
