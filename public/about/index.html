<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>The Women in R task force was set up by the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/foundation/">R Foundation</a> in December
2015 to address the underrepresentation of women among contributors to the R
project and in the R community more generally.</p>

<p>The members of the task force were invited to participate based on their
interest in addressing the gender imbalance and their contributions in this
area, as well as to give a reasonable balance of different genders, different
geographic regions, different work contexts, different career stages and
different aspects of the R project (e.g. CRAN and Bioconductor).</p>

<p>The task force is happy to engage with other individuals and organisations (such
as <a href="http://r-ladies.org">R-ladies</a>) that are concerned about this issue and
actively seeks outside contributions on specific tasks.</p>
